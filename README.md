Key Features:
Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches up-to-date weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and pressure using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Search by City: Users can search for weather information by entering the name of any city or location, and the app displays accurate and current weather data.
Clear and Simple UI: Built with the PyQt5 framework, the app features a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. It displays the data in a simple format, including icons representing the weather conditions.
Location-Based Forecast: The app can also display weather data for the user’s current location by automatically detecting the city through the OpenWeatherMap API’s geolocation feature.
Error Handling: The app ensures smooth functionality with error handling for incorrect city names or API issues, providing the user with clear feedback.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for building the app’s logic.
PyQt5: The graphical framework for building the interactive, cross-platform user interface.
OpenWeatherMap API: A comprehensive weather data service that powers the app with accurate and real-time weather information.
This project showcases the integration of Python programming with third-party APIs and a graphical user interface (GUI) using PyQt5, demonstrating the ability to create practical and dynamic applications. The app can be further enhanced with additional features such as forecasts, map integration, or notifications.
